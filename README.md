# Short Git Tutorial
## "5 minute Git"

### 📖 <a href="https://alicelepissier.com/git-tutorial/slides.html">Slides</a>

Git is awesome, but can be overwhelming 🤯 if you are new to it.

I wager that I can teach you the basics of version control and GitHub in 5 minutes.

This tutorial focuses on teaching you the techniques you need to _actually_ get started.

We will use GitHub Desktop as the 🖱️ Graphical User Interface (GUI). The ⌨️ Command Line Interface (CLI) is great to perform more complex operations, but using the GUI at first can actually help you learn Git faster. No-one is giving out any nerd points 🤓🏆 for struggling through the CLI for the sake of it.

But, this tutorial still provides you with the essential command line techniques you need for "5 minute Git", along with some 💡 extra tips.

**Enjoy!**
